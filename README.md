# PDF Page Splitter

`PDF Page Splitter` is an efficient, console-based C# application that reads and processes PDF files from a specified folder, identifies any existing whitespace labels, and subsequently creates separate, paginated PDF files. The application not only robustly handles errors but also maintains a comprehensive logging system for all operational activities.
